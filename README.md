I've replicated a typical workflow to offer insight into what my development cycle would look like. 
- Product Backlog: Because of the scope of this project, I've chosen to use Github Issues as my project backlog. For enterprise projects, I'd describe a more atomic, extensive backlog on a platform like Jira, CLickup, or Backlog
- Wireframes, Templates, Mockups: My typical development proccess starts with mockups in Figma or other to guide the development proccess. Because I knew the MUI Data Grid/Forms were going to describe the entirety of the project, I prioritized starting development.

#### BREIF:
This will show a simple UI with components, lists, and routing. 
JSON data storage.

The student entity should comprise of the following fields (Id, forename, surname,
Form, and a SEND Boolean of Yes or No)
